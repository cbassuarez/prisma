# Talismans & Easter Eggs

## 1. Overview & Interaction Rules
Talismans are small artifacts placed in the world—tape marks, tokens, stickers, and small sound-makers. They punctuate the routes and invite touch. Audience interaction: T2 corpus tokens and many T3 glitched instructions may be picked up, moved, or kept. T1 route markers and most T4 sound-makers should remain fixed; if moved accidentally, they can be gently repositioned by crew.

## 2. T1 – Route Markers (Struck Measures)
- Description: Tape markers or floor tags in route colors (A=red, B=blue, C=yellow, D=green). They signal that the score has passed or will pass here.
- Rules: Maintain consistent color; keep density to 1–2 per 20 feet to avoid clutter. Place near turns or thresholds.
- Example shapes/patterns: 
  - Double-dash in route color pointing forward. 
  - Small circle with embedded letter (A/B/C/D). 
  - Ladder-like three lines indicating stairs. 
  - Chevron at a corner pointing into the turn. 
  - Crosshair marking a pause point.
- Corpora/Operations: Corpus B + D; Operations MAP + FREEZE.

## 3. T2 – Corpus Tokens
Small cards/coins/tags with single words, glyphs, or micro-text. Built via FRAGMENT + FREEZE + REANIMATE from corpora A, D, C, E. Audience may pick up or keep these; cameras should capture them in situ.
- Examples with in-world explanations:
  1. "BEAST" coin – a key to the final chord. 
  2. "lat:34.155" tag – a coordinate anchor. 
  3. "corriente" card – a whisper that the corridor is alive. 
  4. "BOOK" shard – page torn from the larger score. 
  5. "buffering…" slip – a stalled instruction waiting to load. 
  6. "handrail hymn" tag – instructs you to listen to metal. 
  7. "20:00" chip – time glyph; keep until arrival. 
  8. "route-B / azul" coin – identifies the blue path. 
  9. "re-enter" sticker – permission to rejoin. 
  10. "corridor = código" slip – maps hallway to code. 
  11. "Beast://ready" card – digital chant. 
  12. "PAUSA" tag – invites a breath. 
  13. "SYNC" coin – signal to align with nearby camera. 
  14. "quiet loud" tag – dual-state reminder. 
  15. "frag / ment" split card – a FRAGMENT frozen mid-word. 
  16. "mapa vivo" sticker – the map is alive.

## 4. T3 – Glitched Instructions
Tiny slips or stickers that look like broken safety/field instructions. Place at risk points (stairs, tight corners) but avoid conflict with real safety signage. Corpus C + E with FRAGMENT + MAP + REANIMATE.
- Example lines:
  1. "IN CASE OF SCORE, DO NOT RUN."
  2. "HANDRAIL=ON / SIGNAL=LIVE."
  3. "EXIT? REBUFFER FIRST."
  4. "STAIRS SYNCING… HOLD." 
  5. "MIND THE GAP // mente la brecha." 
  6. "QUIET HOURS / LOUD FOOTSTEPS ALLOWED." 
  7. "NO FIRE, ONLY SIGNAL." 
  8. "IF LOST: WAIT FOR ROUTE UPDATE." 
  9. "CORRIDOR CURRENT UNSTABLE – SLOW." 
  10. "RECALCULATING // recalculando." 

## 5. T4 – Small Sound-Makers
Permanent or semi-permanent small sound objects. They can remain after the show if allowed. Built from low-cost materials.
- Examples:
  1. Mini brass bell zip-tied to railing at hand height; performers strike gently when passing. 
  2. Metal binder clip with paper insert on chain-link fence; rattle softly in wind. 
  3. Wooden tongue depressor taped to vent grille; hums when brushed. 
  4. Small spring screwed to wooden block (if permitted) near stage edge; pluck lightly. 
  5. Keyring of metal washers hung from stair rail; jingles when moved. 
  6. Magnetized bottlecap shaker attached to locker door; tap to sound. 
  7. Plastic rainstick tube hidden under bench; tilt slowly when waiting.

## 6. Budget & Fabrication Notes
- Total small-material budget: up to $500 for printing and fabrication.
- Suggested allocations: 
  - $180 for posters (H/I/R/F/E) and postcards. 
  - $80 for stickers and T3 slips. 
  - $70 for tape (route colors) and floor markers. 
  - $100 for talisman materials (coins, tags, small hardware). 
  - $70 reserve for contingency (reprints, replacement bells).
- Use standard matte paper and removable tape/adhesive to avoid damage. Prefer hardware-store items for sound-makers; avoid specialty fabrication unless within budget.
