# Posters as Walls Score

## 1. Typography & Visual Rules
- **Display / headings:** EB Garamond for titles and invocations.
- **Body, coordinates, labels, data:** IBM Plex Mono for instructions, coordinates, and map-like info.
- **Inversions:** Fragment posters (F) may use all-mono to feel like code/terminal outputs. Error posters (E) can invert colors (dark background, light mono) to signal glitch state.
- **Color & density:** Hero and Instructional posters use high contrast with generous white space. Fragment and Error posters may layer translucent paper or overlapping prints. Route glyphs retain strong route colors. Paper can be standard matte; layering and tape edges are part of the aesthetic.

## 2. Hero Posters (H)
**Function:** Large, iconic signals that announce PRISMA and orient the BOOK OF MOVES.

**Required elements:** "PRISMA" and "BOOK OF MOVES."

**Tagline candidates:**
1. "Begin everywhere. Converge at the Wild Beast."
2. "Routes awake across campus. The Wild Beast gathers them." 
3. "Start scattered. Finish at the Wild Beast."

**Official recurring tagline:** "Begin everywhere. Converge at the Wild Beast." (Corpus A + D + B; Operations: MAP + FREEZE.)

**Layouts (textual):**
- Layout 1: Top third "PRISMA" in EB Garamond; center "BOOK OF MOVES"; bottom band with tagline in IBM Plex Mono, small route color dots.
- Layout 2: Left-aligned vertical stack: PRISMA / BOOK OF MOVES / tagline; right margin holds map-like coordinates of key hubs.

## 3. Instructional Posters (I)
**Mode:** Field Manual-style. Two structural variants: 3-step protocols and short paragraphs.

### 3-step protocols
1. **Poster I-1** (Corpus C + D + B; MAP + FREEZE):
   1. Start from your nearest corridor hub. 
   2. Follow the route color nearest you until it bends toward the Wild Beast.
   3. Arrive by 20:00; hold your place; let the Beast collect the routes.

2. **Poster I-2** (Corpus C + D + B; MAP + FREEZE + FRAGMENT):
   1. Locate a Route glyph (A/B/C/D). 
   2. Walk the arrows; pause at any Fragment poster and listen. 
   3. At 19:55, move with whoever is there; converge at the Wild Beast.

3. **Poster I-3** (Corpus C + D + B; MAP + FREEZE):
   1. Choose a route: red A, blue B, yellow C, green D. 
   2. Keep the color in sight; if you lose it, wait for the next glyph. 
   3. All routes combine at 20:00 on the Wild Beast lawn.

### Paragraph protocols
4. **Poster I-4** (Corpus C + D + B; MAP + FRAGMENT):
   Follow the posted color nearest you. You may join at any point and leave if needed. The corridors behave like lines of music; listen for footsteps and small bells. All paths resolve at the Wild Beast at 20:00.

5. **Poster I-5** (Corpus C + D + B; MAP + FREEZE):
   Begin where you stand. Move toward the next visible Route glyph. Pause at posters marked "BOOK OF MOVES" to read. Continue until the lawn appears; stay clear of service lanes. The Wild Beast is the final measure.

6. **Poster I-6** (Corpus C + D + B; MAP + FREEZE + FRAGMENT):
   This is a live score. Start in silence, then follow the color that finds you. If you meet cameras, continue; they are part of the route. By 20:00, gather under the Wild Beast awning and remain attentive.

## 4. Route Glyph Posters (R)
**Role:** Breadcrumbs for routes A/B/C/D with consistent colors (A=red, B=blue, C=yellow, D=green). Corpus B + D; Operations: MAP + FREEZE.

**Route A (red) phrases:** "A: CORRIDOR CURRENT", "A: RED LINE = BREATHLINE", "A: ATRIUM SPOOL."
**Route B (blue) phrases:** "B: SUBLEVEL FUGUE", "B: BLUE RAMP = DRONE", "B: UNDERPATH CHORUS."
**Route C (yellow) phrases:** "C: ROOFTOP GLINT", "C: SUNSTRIP MEASURE", "C: OPEN QUAD HARMONIC."
**Route D (green) phrases:** "D: COURTYARD VEIN", "D: GARDEN COUNTERPOINT", "D: NORTH PATH PHRASE."

Placement: near turns, corridor entrances, and decision points; low enough to be read while walking, visible to cameras.

## 5. Fragment Posters (F)
**Nature:** Palimpsestic layers with cross-outs and overwriting. Built via FRAGMENT + CONSTRUCT/DESTROY + REANIMATE from corpora A, C, D, E.

Example fragment texts (annotated):
1. "handrail knows the tempo" (Source: C; Operations: FREEZE → REANIMATE.)
2. "código roto / corridor current" (Sources: E Spanish + D; Operations: FRAGMENT + MAP.)
3. "BOOK OF M__ / MOVE / ???" scratched (Sources: A + D; Operations: CONSTRUCT/DESTROY.)
4. "404: stairwell not found" (Sources: E + B; Operations: FRAGMENT + REANIMATE.)
5. "espera / escucha / escalera" (Spanish for wait/listen/stair) (Sources: C + D; Operations: FRAGMENT.)
6. "la bête appelle" (French: the beast calls) (Sources: D; Operations: FRAGMENT + FREEZE.)
7. "buffering… converge" (Sources: E + A; Operations: FRAGMENT + MAP.)
8. "retourne le fragment" (French) (Sources: D; Operations: REANIMATE.)
9. "stay clear / stay near" overlapped (Sources: C; Operations: CONSTRUCT/DESTROY.)
10. "lat:34.155 // Wild Beast" (Sources: E + B; Operations: MAP + FREEZE.)
11. "el pasillo canta" (Spanish: the corridor sings) (Sources: D; Operations: FRAGMENT.)
12. "hand / rail / hymn" stacked (Sources: C + D; Operations: FRAGMENT + CONSTRUCT.)
13. "sync drift detected // re-enter" (Sources: E; Operations: FRAGMENT + REANIMATE.)
14. "corridor current // corriente" bilingual overlay (Sources: B + D; Operations: MAP + CONSTRUCT.)
15. "quiet hours / loud footsteps" cross-hatched (Sources: C; Operations: CONSTRUCT/DESTROY.)

## 6. Error / Glitch Posters (E)
**Definition:** In-world system messages and broken UI echoes. Corpus E with D + C; Operations: FRAGMENT + MAP + REANIMATE.

Example error posters:
1. "status: route-A / desync 19:42" (Sources: E + B; Operations: MAP + FRAGMENT.)
2. "ROUTE NOT FOUND // ruta no encontrada" (Sources: E + Spanish; Operations: FRAGMENT + REANIMATE.)
3. "timeout // Wild Beast unreachable" (Sources: E + B; Operations: FRAGMENT.)
4. "http://prisma.live/beast 503 temporarily asleep" (Sources: E; Operations: MAP + REANIMATE.)
5. "buffering FIELD MANUAL…" (Sources: E + C; Operations: FRAGMENT.)
6. "reconnect stairs? y/n" (Sources: E + B; Operations: MAP.)
7. "update failed / VOICE A" (Sources: E + D; Operations: CONSTRUCT/DESTROY + REANIMATE.)
8. "latency spike – corridor current unstable" (Sources: E + B + D; Operations: MAP + FRAGMENT.)

## 7. Placement Principles
- **H – Hero:** Entrances, high-traffic hubs, outside/near the Wild Beast. Visible from distance.
- **I – Instructional:** Spawn points, midday hubs, near start of routes; maintain clarity and safety.
- **R – Route glyph:** Interspersed along corridors and outdoors; spaced to suggest rhythm, not clutter.
- **F – Fragment:** Quieter areas, corners, stairwells; encourage discovery and close reading.
- **E – Error:** Thresholds and liminal spaces (doorways, floor transitions, elevators) to hint at glitches in the route system.
