# Engine & Rulebook

## 1. Premise

### Logline
PRISMA is a campus-wide, processional score where four performers and four cameras animate mapped corridors and stairwells, guiding audiences from scattered starting points toward a convergence at the Wild Beast.

### Plain-language description
PRISMA stages CalArts as a living book. Four performers move along four color-coded routes across campus, shadowed by four cinematographers. Audiences encounter posters, signage, talismans, and a digital map that invite them to join from wherever they are and walk toward the Wild Beast for the culmination. The environment is treated as notation: walls, floors, and coordinates become lines in the score.

### Ritual description
The score wakes in the corridors and begins to write itself using the campus as page. Each corridor is a measure, each stair a modulation. The Wild Beast pulls the ink of footsteps, summoning FRAGMENTs into alignment. Cameras mirror the spell, MAPping light onto the BOOK OF MOVES.

## 2. Corpora

### Corpus A – PRISMA score
The notated structure, textual score, and conceptual instructions of PRISMA. It contains tempo cues, processional timings, and titles like "BOOK OF MOVES."
- Example: "Begin dispersed; converge on the Beast at twilight." 
- Example: "Hold silence in stairwells; let footsteps be rhythm." 
- Example: "Routes spiral inward, never backtracking." 
- Example: "Four voices: performer, camera, wall, map." 
- Example: "Wild Beast = attractor / final chord." 

### Corpus B – Campus map / architecture
Names and shapes of rooms, corridors, stairwells, landmarks, and the Wild Beast stage. This is the physical grid the score inhabits.
- Example: "E-block corridor: long, fluorescent, polished." 
- Example: "Sublevel ramp under Main Gallery." 
- Example: "Stairwell between music practice rooms." 
- Example: "Outdoor path leading to the Wild Beast lawn." 
- Example: "Elevator bank adjacent to library." 

### Corpus C – Institutional language
Administrative, handbook, and signage idioms that define official tone and safety expectations.
- Example: "Emergency Exit – Keep Clear." 
- Example: "Campus Safety contact: 24/7." 
- Example: "Policy: Authorized access only." 
- Example: "Quiet Hours in effect." 
- Example: "Use handrail; proceed with caution." 

### Corpus D – Ritual lexicon
The invented ritual language of PRISMA: commands, invocations, and keywords that animate the space.
- Example: "Enter the BOOK OF MOVES." 
- Example: "Follow the corridor current." 
- Example: "Mark the threshold with breath." 
- Example: "Fold sound into stairwells." 
- Example: "Return the fragment to the Beast." 

### Corpus E – Digital traces
App UI copy, URLs, error messages, status messages, timestamps, and glitch text harvested from digital systems.
- Example: "loading… / route-A: 67%." 
- Example: "404: Wild Beast not found." 
- Example: "sync drift detected." 
- Example: "lat:34.155 / long:-118.078 / 19:42 PST." 
- Example: "buffering field manual." 

## 3. Operations

### FRAGMENT
Break a text or map element into shorter shards, stripping context to leave charged remnants.
- Corridor label (Corpus B): "E-block corridor" → FRAGMENT → "E-block" / "corridor current." 
- Instruction (Corpus C): "Emergency Exit – Keep Clear" → FRAGMENT → "Exit—Clear." 

### CONSTRUCT/DESTROY
Layer multiple shards together, then partially erase or overwrite to show palimpsest.
- Combine Corpus A title "BOOK OF MOVES" with Corpus D "Return the fragment" → CONSTRUCT → "BOOK OF RETURN" → DESTROY → cross out "RETURN" leaving ghosted letters.
- Merge Campus map label "Sublevel ramp" with digital timestamp from Corpus E → CONSTRUCT → "RAMP 19:42" → DESTROY → scrawl through time to suggest instability.

### FREEZE
Capture one instruction, phrase, or map relationship as permanently true.
- From Corpus A: "Converge at Wild Beast" → FREEZE → printed on Hero poster as unwavering directive.
- From Corpus C: "Use handrail" → FREEZE → safety overlay on stairwell signage.

### MAP
Translate between domains: room to note, corridor to phrase, route to code-line.
- Corridor (Corpus B) → MAP → ritual command (Corpus D): "Stairwell between practice rooms" → "Tune your breath to the stairwell." 
- Route color (Corpus B) → MAP → app UI (Corpus E): "Route C / yellow" → "status: C-channel active." 

### REANIMATE
Bring a previously frozen fragment back in a new form or location.
- Frozen tagline "Converge at Wild Beast" reappears as a whisper on a fragment poster beside a vending machine.
- Safety line "Use handrail" returns as ritual aside: "The handrail knows the tempo." 

## 4. Diegetic Rulebook
- The score exists inside the world: walls, objects, routes, and app screens are all pages of PRISMA, not outside documentation.
- Any printed, taped, or projected object placed for PRISMA is part of the score, never marketing; nothing is extraneous.
- Text and space are interchangeable: corridors behave like phrases, routes like sentences, stairwells like modulations.
- Cameras, map, and audience are participants in the same corpus; no purely external observers.
- Once placed, a FREEZE holds until REANIMATE moves it; nothing vanishes without trace.
- Institutional echoes must stay legible; FRAGMENT cannot obscure real safety information.

## 5. Safety & “Cannot Do” Constraints
- Do not imitate or replace real emergency signage; avoid red/white evacuation styles and arrows that could mislead.
- Do not post instructions that contradict real guidance: never encourage running, ignoring staff, or blocking exits.
- Do not use props that mimic real safety equipment (alarms, extinguishers, emergency phones); only neutral objects.
- It is acceptable to echo institutional language (Corpus C) but only when clearly framed as art; real signage must remain visible and unobstructed.
- All talismans and posters must be easily removable and leave no damage to walls, floors, or fixtures.
