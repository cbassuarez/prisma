# PRISMA – Field Version

## 1. What This Is
PRISMA is a campus-wide processional performance: four performers and four cameras travel along color-coded routes, inviting audiences to join from anywhere and converge at the Wild Beast at 20:00. Posters, talismans, and a digital map are part of the living score.

## 2. How the World Works (Quick)
- **Corpora:** A – PRISMA score; B – Campus map/architecture; C – Institutional language; D – Ritual lexicon; E – Digital traces.
- **Operations:** FRAGMENT (cut into shards); CONSTRUCT/DESTROY (layer and erase); FREEZE (fix an instruction); MAP (translate space to text); REANIMATE (bring a fragment back elsewhere).

## 3. Scenic Cheat Sheet
- **H – Hero posters:** Big PRISMA/BOOK OF MOVES with tagline "Begin everywhere. Converge at the Wild Beast." Hubs, entrances, near the Beast.
- **I – Instructional posters:** Field Manual clarity; 3-step or paragraph; appear at spawn points and along routes.
- **R – Route glyphs:** Color-coded breadcrumbs (A red, B blue, C yellow, D green); placed at turns/decision points.
- **F – Fragment posters:** Layered, crossed-out palimpsests; hide in corners, stairwells, quiet halls.
- **E – Error posters:** Glitch/system messages; live at thresholds, elevators, doorways.

## 4. Voices Cheat Sheet
- **Voice A – Ritual:** Imperative, uncanny. Sample: "Follow the corridor current; do not look back." 
- **Voice B – Field Manual:** Neutral and clear. Sample: "Four routes begin across campus; all end at the Wild Beast at 20:00." 
- **Voice C – Safety:** Caring and practical. Sample: "Walk slowly; the score waits for you." Labels `VOICE A/B/C` may appear in corners.

## 5. Talismans Cheat Sheet
- **T1 Route Markers:** Tape or floor tags in route colors; stay in place; mark that the score passes here.
- **T2 Corpus Tokens:** Small cards/coins with single words like "BEAST" or "20:00"; audiences may pick up; cameras capture.
- **T3 Glitched Instructions:** Tiny stickers with broken safety text (e.g., "IN CASE OF SCORE, DO NOT RUN"); place at stairs/corners; removable.
- **T4 Small Sound-Makers:** Bells, clips, rails marked for sound; mostly fixed; performers may strike gently.

## 6. Quick Notes for Cameras
- Follow your assigned performer but bank shots of posters, talismans, and route markers as co-performers.
- Grab close-ups of tokens on floors/rails; hold still for 10 seconds when safe.
- Money shot hints: red tape dashes leading to a Hero poster; Fragment poster with a handrail in focus; convergence of all colors at the Wild Beast.
- Safety: keep tripods clear of exits; move slowly on stairs; respect staff directions.
