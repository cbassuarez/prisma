# Scenic Systems Overview

## 1. Families of Artifacts
- **Posters**: Wall-based pages of the score. They deliver narrative signals, invite movement, and display ritual or instructional text. They act as static beats the performers and cameras can orient to.
- **Signage**: Functional instructions differentiated by voice (A/B/C). They ensure audiences know how to move, when to gather, and how to stay safe while remaining in-world.
- **Talismans & small objects**: Tokens, markers, and small sound-makers that punctuate surfaces and floors. They offer tactile entry points and collectible fragments.
- **Instruments / sound props**: Planted and portable sonic objects that extend the score into material vibration—bells, bowed rails, clipped metal resonators.
- **Map/postcards & digital map**: The interface layer; printed maps and app-like UI fragments that help audiences MAP routes and feel the digital trace of the score.

## 2. Corpora & Operations Matrix
| Element type        | Corpus sources | Operations                             | Where it lives             | Teams involved     |
| ------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| H – Hero poster     | A, D, B        | FREEZE, MAP                            | Entrances, hubs            | Scenic, Cameras    |
| I – Instructional   | C, D, B        | MAP, FREEZE, FRAGMENT                  | Spawn points, routes       | Scenic, Faculty    |
| R – Route glyph     | B, D           | MAP, FREEZE                            | Along routes               | Scenic             |
| F – Fragment poster | A, C, D, E     | FRAGMENT, CONSTRUCT/DESTROY, REANIMATE | Corners, stairwells        | Scenic, Cameras    |
| E – Error poster    | E, C, D        | FRAGMENT, MAP, REANIMATE               | Thresholds, liminal spaces | Scenic, App team   |
| T1–T4 talismans     | (varies)       | (varies)                               | Surfaces, floors, etc.     | Scenic, Performers |

Read the matrix as a cross-reference: for any element, note its corpus sources, which operations build it, where it should appear, and which teams must coordinate. Example: an Instructional poster draws from institutional tone (C), ritual prompts (D), and site (B), using MAP and FREEZE to stay legible, with optional FRAGMENT for poetic texture.

## 3. Example Scenic Compositions

### Composition 1: Stairwell Landing
- Elements: One Instructional poster (I), one Fragment poster (F), scattered talismans (T2 tokens on steps), one Route glyph (R) on the wall.
- Corpora/operations: B + C + D via MAP and FREEZE for the Instructional; A + E via FRAGMENT and REANIMATE for the Fragment; B + D via MAP for the glyph.
- Camera framing: Start wide to capture the layered wall, then glide up the stairs to isolate a T2 token in macro. Use the Route glyph as a leading line.

### Composition 2: Outdoor Path Bend
- Elements: Route glyph (R) on pavement, Hero poster (H) on nearby lamppost, talismans T1 tape markers at ground level, T4 bell clipped to railing.
- Corpora/operations: B + D FREEZE for R; A + D FREEZE for H; B MAP for T1; A + D REANIMATE for T4 interaction prompt.
- Camera framing: Low angle tracking along the tape markers to the bell; rack focus from the ground glyph to the Hero poster to show vertical layering.

### Composition 3: Corridor Threshold
- Elements: Error poster (E) beside doorway, Fragment poster (F) partially covering an old announcement board, Instructional paragraph poster (I) adjacent, plus a pair of T3 glitched stickers on the doorframe.
- Corpora/operations: E draws from Corpus E + C with FRAGMENT and MAP; F layers A + D + E with CONSTRUCT/DESTROY; I uses C + D + B with MAP + FREEZE; T3 uses C + E with FRAGMENT.
- Camera framing: Hold a locked-off shot capturing the doorway as performers pass; pan to the Fragment poster to reveal palimpsest textures; insert close-up of T3 sticker to show glitch language.
