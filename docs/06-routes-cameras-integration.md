# Routes, Scenic, & Cameras

## 1. Overview
This document synchronizes route paths, scenic density, and camera attention. It highlights where scenic systems cluster, how routes feel, and what cameras should prioritize without prescribing a rigid shot list.

## 2. Route Summaries

### Route A (Red)
Character: Direct corridor currents and atrium passes; tends to live in interior hallways that echo footsteps.
- Scenic preference: Hero posters near entrances, strong Route glyphs, Instructional posters early, Fragment posters at stairwells.
- Approach to Beast: Emerges from main building hallway toward the Wild Beast via a firm straight line, inviting processional momentum.

### Route B (Blue)
Character: Sublevel ramps and basement-like stretches; cooler, reverberant spaces.
- Scenic preference: Error posters near elevators, Route glyphs on ramps, T1 tape markers near slopes, T4 resonant clips on railings.
- Approach to Beast: Rises from below, appearing on the lawn from a lower access path; cameras catch ascents.

### Route C (Yellow)
Character: Rooftop-adjacent or sunlit corridors; playful, flickering light.
- Scenic preference: Hero posters near windows, Fragment posters where light breaks, T2 tokens on ledges, Route glyphs at rooftop access points.
- Approach to Beast: Curves through outdoor walkways, descending with sunlight behind performers.

### Route D (Green)
Character: Garden edges and courtyard veins; softer pacing, foliage cues.
- Scenic preference: Instructional posters near courtyards, T3 glitched stickers on garden gates, Route glyphs on pavement, T4 bells tied to benches.
- Approach to Beast: Enters along grassy paths, merging laterally into the crowd with leafy framing.

## 3. Scenic Hot Zones
- **Route A Hot Zones**
  - Atrium landing: H + I + R + F; cameras dolly alongside performers; capture high ceiling reflections.
  - Main stairwell: R + F + T1 + T2; macro on tokens, wide shot on stairs, listen for handrail tempo.
- **Route B Hot Zones**
  - Sublevel ramp: E + R + T1 + T4; low-angle tracking of ramp markers, handheld follow on performer breath.
  - Elevator bank: E + I + T3; static frame on doors opening, close-up of glitch stickers.
- **Route C Hot Zones**
  - Window corridor: H + F + T2; silhouette shots with sunlight, focus pulls between posters and skyline.
  - Rooftop access: R + E + T1; overhead view of glyphs, camera matches performer footsteps.
- **Route D Hot Zones**
  - Courtyard gate: I + R + T3 + T4 bell; capture gate swing and bell strike; medium shot through foliage.
  - Garden path bend: F + T2 + T1; lateral tracking through plants, token close-ups near ground.

## 4. Camera Guidance
- Treat scenic elements as co-performers: posters are faces, talismans are handheld props, route markers are rhythm.
- Prioritize performers when moving, but allow 10–15 second holds on walls or talismans to show the score writing itself.
- Money shots:
  1. Macro of T2 token on stair tread with Fragment poster blurred behind (Corpora A/C/D/E; Operations FRAGMENT + REANIMATE visible).
  2. Tracking the red Route A tape dashes leading to a Hero poster (Corpora B/D/A; Operations MAP + FREEZE).
  3. Wide shot of all four routes converging on the Wild Beast with layered posters in frame (Corpora B/A/D; Operations FREEZE + MAP).
  4. Tilt from Error poster (E) to performer passing through doorway, showing glitch to action (Corpora E/B/D; Operations FRAGMENT + MAP).
  5. Slow pan across T4 bell as a performer strikes it, revealing the audience behind (Corpora D/B; Operations REANIMATE + MAP).
- Keep movement smooth around thresholds and stairwells; safety first while maintaining diegesis.
