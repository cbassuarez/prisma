# Signage & Voice Lexicon

## 1. Voices
- **Voice A – Ritual Command:** Second person, imperative, uncanny; feels like the world instructing you. Draws on Corpus D with echoes of B.
- **Voice B – Field Manual:** Clear, neutral, almost bureaucratic; explains where/when/how in straightforward language using Corpus C + B with MAP from A.
- **Voice C – Safety:** Genuinely helpful and diegetic; cares for bodies in space, using Corpus C with minimal ritual veneer.

Signs may carry a small corner label in IBM Plex Mono such as `VOICE A / RITUAL`, `VOICE B / FIELD MANUAL`, or `VOICE C / SAFETY` to mark tone without breaking diegesis.

## 2. Voice A – Ritual Commands
Imperative lines that animate space. (Corpus D with MAP from B; Operations: FRAGMENT + FREEZE + REANIMATE.)

4. Hold silence until the rail sings.
5. Leave a breath at each landing.
6. Carry the red line like a pulse.
7. Breathe blue when the ramp descends.
8. Let the yellow corridor name you.
9. Green path remembers your weight.
10. Split, then fuse at the Beast.
11. Trace the wall; map the note.
12. El pasillo canta; escucha.
13. Sous la bête, échoue ta voix.

27. La ruta vuelve; no resistas.
28. Cross out your shadow; keep walking.

## 3. Voice B – Field Manual
Plain lines to orient participants. (Corpus C + B; Operations: MAP + FREEZE.)
1. Performance routes are active this evening.
2. Four routes begin across campus; all end at the Wild Beast at 20:00.

5. If you lose a marker, continue forward; the next one appears soon.
6. Posters marked "BOOK OF MOVES" are part of the score, not advertisements.
7. Cameras and performers are working together; you are welcome to walk near them.

## 4. Voice C – Safety
Caring guidance that remains diegetic. (Corpus C; Operations: FREEZE + MAP.)
1. Walk slowly; the score waits for you.
2. Hold the handrail; the stair is part of the music.
3. Do not block doorways or emergency exits.
4. Keep routes clear for mobility devices.

## 5. Using Voices in Signage
- Instructional posters (I) primarily use Voice B for clarity, with occasional Voice A overlays as small italics or ghost text to maintain ritual charge.
- Safety signage always uses Voice C; a minimal Voice A echo may sit in a corner to keep diegesis without undermining safety.
- Composite sign example 1: Main text in Voice B: "Four routes converge at the Wild Beast at 20:00." Lower corner Voice C: "Walk slowly; handrails are part of the piece." Upper margin Voice A faintly: "The Beast hears each step."
- Composite sign example 2: Voice B: "Follow green Route D toward the lawn." Voice C: "Keep right on stairs." Voice A (small): "Gardens remember." Labels `VOICE B / FIELD MANUAL` and `VOICE C / SAFETY` appear in the lower corner, with `VOICE A / RITUAL` ghosted near the top.
- Composite sign example 3: Voice B paragraph on joining/leaving routes; Voice A single line "Freeze here at 19:59" handwritten; Voice C small icon reminding to keep exits clear.
