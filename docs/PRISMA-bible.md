# PRISMA – Show Bible (CalArts Edition)

## Logline
PRISMA is a campus-scale score that unfolds as a procession from many starting points toward the Wild Beast, blending mapped corridors, ritual text, and live cameras into a living "BOOK OF MOVES." The piece activates CalArts architecture as notation, asking audiences to follow routes, listen to the walls, and converge for a shared arrival.

## Plain-language overview
PRISMA is a guided performance and installation spread across campus. Four performers travel along four color-coded routes while four cinematographers follow, streaming or capturing the journey. The public joins along the way via posters, signage, talismans, and a digital map, moving from their own starting points toward a final gathering at the Wild Beast. All printed pieces in the environment are part of the score rather than marketing.

## Ritual description
The corridors speak the score awake. Every hallway is a line of text, every stair a modulation. The Wild Beast pulls routes like a lodestone, reassembling FRAGMENTs of instructions into a new book written by footsteps. The cameras are mirrors, the audience is ink.
